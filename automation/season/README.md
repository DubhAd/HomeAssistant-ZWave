# Automations, automations everywhere, and all the brains did hurt

Documentation: [automation](https://home-assistant.io/docs/automation/)

_Some of these were first written when I started with HA, and didn't know better. You'll find that I've used hyphens (-) in some file names and underscores (\_) to match Home Assistant in others. Mostly I'm not renaming files._

## Seasons

I track the seasons, and holidays, to use as conditions and triggers - writeup to follow.

### season_is_autumn.yaml
### season_is_christmas.yaml
### season_is_easter.yaml
### season_is_spring.yaml
### season_is_summer.yaml
### season_is_winter.yaml

## Christmas

Turn on and off the Christmas lights.

### christmas_lights_off_season.yaml
### christmas_lights_off.yaml
### christmas_lights_on.yaml

## Winter 

None of these are needed any more, but I've not culled them yet.

### winter_lights_off_season.yaml
### winter_lights_off.yaml
### winter_lights_on.yaml

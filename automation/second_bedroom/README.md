# Automations, automations everywhere, and all the brains did hurt

Documentation: [automation](https://home-assistant.io/docs/automation/)

_Some of these were first written when I started with HA, and didn't know better. You'll find that I've used hyphens (-) in some file names and underscores (\_) to match Home Assistant in others. Mostly I'm not renaming files._

### person1-up-bedhead-light-on.yaml

When the alarm goes off, turn on the light strip.

### person1_up_reminder.yaml

Sometimes they've got issues of actually waking up that even the light strip doesn't help. This waits for three minutes after the alarm went off, on a non-holiday, and runs a script to be unsubtle.

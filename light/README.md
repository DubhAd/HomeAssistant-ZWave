# Let there be light!

Components:
* [Yeelight](https://home-assistant.io/components/light.yeelight/)
* [Hue](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/hue/)
* [light group](https://home-assistant.io/components/light.group/)

I'm using the [Yeelight](https://home-assistant.io/components/light.yeelight/) with a couple of LED strips, and a light group containing both lights. These are in the main bedrooms, to provide low level lighting, but also come on with the smart radio alarms.

The Hue hub I'm using with a [Gledopto GL-C-008](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/GLEDOPTO-ZIGBEE-Led-Controller-Amazon-Echo-hue-lightify-tradfri-compatible-LED-controller-RGB-CCT-WW-CW/32858603964.html) 
RGB+CCT LED Controller, a roll of 60 LED/m RGB-CCT LED tape, and a 24V power supply, as explained [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/361560/how-to-make-your-own-philips-hue-lightstrips-for-cheap/) 
and [here](https://char.gd/blog/2018/building-better-cheaper-philips-hue-led-strips). At minimum brightness this provides sufficient low level lighting for our hall, at maximum brightness it lights up the adjoining rooms.

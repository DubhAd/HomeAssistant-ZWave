# Input Selects

Component: [input select](https://home-assistant.io/components/input_select/)

## People

For use with Phil Hawthorne's [making presence detection not so binary](https://philhawthorne.com/making-home-assistants-presence-detection-not-so-binary/) automations. 

## Rooms

I split up a lot of the room based logic, turning a smaller number of monster automations into a larger number of simpler automations. These set and use these input selects, which indicate the state of the room.

## Season

For use in various lighting automations (and probably others in the future). While it's called season, it also covers other events.

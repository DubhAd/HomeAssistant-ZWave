# Dashboards

Currently there's only one of these that sees regular use - the one for the phone.

At some point I'll set up permanent displays and make more use of these.

## Main
This one is a bit of a mess, there's no other way of saying it. This one is highly likely to get ditched at some point.

## Widgets

I prefer to define my widgets centrally, so I can re-use them. This file holds all the widgets.

## Google Cast

The Google Cast devices, both Chromecast and Google Home

## Plex

I don't really use this component for automations, or interact with it in any way currently

## Samsung TV

This component is mostly used so I can detect when the TV is on, and control the volume.

## Sonos

I use the Sonos component for various automations, both as a music player, and as a TTS destination.

## Squeezebox

Yes, I have some of the old Squeezebox Radio units, from back when Logitech bought Slimdevices, and before they shut it all down. While almost impossible to find these days, they're still the best smart bedside alarm/media player devices I've found.
